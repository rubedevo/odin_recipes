    <p>With this recipe, your soft boiled egg will turn out great every time. The key to a good soft boiled egg is timing. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Skimmer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to the boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer before adding in the eggs.</li>
        <li>Use a skimmer to place the eggs in the pot. This way you avoid cracking the shell accidentally.</li>
        <li>Immediately set a timer and cook the eggs accordingly
            <ul>
                <li>6 minutes: A liquidy yolk and soft white. This is perfect for eggs served in an egg cup.</li>
                <li>6 1/2 minutes: A soft, jammy yolk. This is my favorite for eggs on toast or soft boiled eggs on a salad.</li>
                <li>8 minutes: A soft yolk but firm enough to hold its own.</li>
                <li>10 minutes: The early stages of a hard boiled egg, with just a smidge of softness in the middle.
                </li>
                <li>12 minutes: A hard boiled egg with a lighter yolk.
                </li>
                <li>14 minutes: Your traditional hard boiled egg with the lightest yolk and a firm white, but not overcooked.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>


    </ol>
